# What is an RPC Node?

An RPC node runs the same software as a validator but it does not participate in the consensus process.  An RPC node responds to requests about the blockchain.  Running an RPC node is similar to providing an api for others to use.

The users of the RPC node are often developers, so this option may require a more technical understanding of Solana.  You can see a list of all of the RPC calls that are available [here](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api).

Also, RPC nodes do not participate in consensus so there is no stake delegation involved and no reward for running the node.
