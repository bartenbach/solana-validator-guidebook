# Should I Run a Validator or an RPC Node?

Operators who run a validator have much different incentives than operators who run an RPC node.

## Consensus Validators

As a validator you primary focus is maintaining the network and making sure that your node is performing optimally so that you can fully participate in the cluster consensus.  You will want to attract a delegation of sol to your validator which will prove that you are more trusted in the network and can therefor vote more often.

A validator receives sol as rewards at the end of an epoch for participating in consensus.


## RPC Nodes

An rpc operator does not receive rewards because the node is not participating in voting. Instead, an rpc operator is providing a service to users who want to interact with the Solana blockchain.  Because your primary user is often technical, you will have to be able to answer technical questions about performance of RPC calls.  This option may require more understanding of the solana algoirthms.

Your job will also involve scaling your system to meet the demands of the users. For example, some RPC providers create dedicate nodes for projects that require a high volume of requests to the node. Someone with a background in development operations or software engineering will likely be a very important part of your team.
