# Solana Validator Prerequisites

Operating a validator is an interesting and rewarding task. It requires someone with a technical background but also involves community engagement and marketing.  Here is a list of some of the requirements for being a good operator:

* Computer hardware and a fast internet connection
    * You can find a list of hardware requirements [here](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs)
    * Solana helps facilitate data center server rentals through the [solana server program](https://solana.foundation/server-program)
* Knowledge of the linux terminal
* Ubuntu system administration
    * Accessing your machine via ssh and scp
    * Installing software (potentially installing from source)
    * Keeping Ubuntu up to date
    * Managing users and system access
    * Understanding computer processes
    * Formatting and mounting drives
* Hardware performance monitoring
* Quick response times in case of an outage
* Marketing and communications to attract users
* Customer support

Whether you decide to run a validator or an rpc node, you should consider all of these areas of expertise.  A team of people is likely necessary for you to achieve your goals.

## Who can become a validator or RPC operator?

Anyone! The network is permissionless and censorship resistent.  It is open for anyone to join at any time.

## Solana Server Program

The Solana server program is a no commitment option for validators and rpc operators.  You can lease servers in data centers all over the world that meet the Solana validator hardware specs.  Additionally, through the server program, there are no long term commitments.  To find out more, visit the [solana server program page](https://solana.foundation/server-program).

## Can I use my computer at home?

While anyone can join the network, you should make sure that your home computer and network meets the specifications in the [hardware requirements](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs) doc.  Most home internet service providers do not provider consistent service that would allow your validator to perform well.

In addition, you will want to make sure that your home computer is resistant to outages caused by loss of power, flooding, fire, theft, etc.  To get started and learn about being an operator, a home setup may be sufficient, but you will want to consider all of these factors when you start operating your validator on mainnet.

## Do I Have To Use the Solana Server Program?

No! You can acquire the computers that you need any way that you like. You can rent a server through a data center without going through the solana server program.  You could also build your own computer and then do a colocation. Colocation is a more technical option for people who are experienced with computer hardware and system administration but it may be a great option in many areas.
