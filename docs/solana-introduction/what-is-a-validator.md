# What is a Validator?

A validator is a computer that is a computer that helps to run the
Solana network.  Without validators, Solana would not be able to function.

In order for the Solana network to be robust and secure, the network of validators must be decentralized. In other words, each validator should be run by an independent entity or person. If a single validator goes offline or has other issues, that will be ok as long as a super majority of validators are online and working appropriately.
