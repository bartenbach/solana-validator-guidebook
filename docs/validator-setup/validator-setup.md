# Validator Setup

1. Install the solana cli on your local (secure) machine if it is not already installed: [install solana cli](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)

2. On your secure machine, Create the 3 keypairs that you will need to run your validator ([docs for reference](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#generate-identity)):

```
solana-keygen new -o validator-keypair.json
solana-keygen new -o vote-account-keypair.json
solana-keygen new -o authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json
```

__IMPORTANT__ the authroized-withdrawer-keypair.json should be stored in a secure place like a hardware wallet or a password protection app and it should not be stored on the validator server. If you lose this keypair, there is no way to get your validator back. More info [here](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#create-authorized-withdrawer-account)

__more info on the vote account [here](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#create-vote-account)__


3. Use the solana network to create a vote account.  This should be done on your local machine (not on your validator):

```
solana create-vote-account ~/vote-account-keypair.json ~/validator-keypair.json ~/authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json
```

4. Make sure your authorized-widthdrawer-keypair is stored in a safe place, then delete it from your local machine.

5. Connect to your remote server. This is specific to your server but will look something like this:

```
ssh root@my.server.hostname
```

6. Create a new ubuntu user for running the validator:

```
sudo adduser sol
```

7. On your ubuntu validator server make sure that you have at least 2TB of disk space mounted. If you have a drive but it is not mounted/formatted, youâ€™ll have to follow the steps [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-format-disk):


8. Make sure you have the latest and greatest package versions on your server

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install
```

9. Switch to the sol user

```
su sol
```

10. Securely copy the validator-keypair.json file and the vote-account-keypair.json file to the validator server. Do not copy the authorized-widthdrawer-keypair to the server

11. In your sol home directory, create a folder called bin. Inside that folder create a file called validator.sh

12. Paste this command in your validator.sh file: https://docs.solana.com/clusters#testnet

13. Follow these instructions for running the validator as a system service: https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#systemd-unit Make sure to implement log rotate as well



14. Verify that your validator is running:
Make sure your pubkey is listed in solana gossip:
```
solana gossip | grep `solana keygen pubkey ~/validator-keypair.json`
```

15. Make sure your validator is catching up:

```
solana catchup `solana keygen pubkey ~/validator-keypair.json`
```

16. If you see a message about trying to connect, your validator is not part of the network yet.

See if your validator is part of the network:

```
solana validators | grep `solana keygen pubkey ~/validator-keypair.json`
```

17. Common issues:

* Out of disk space

Make sure your ledger is on drive with at least 1TB of space

* Validator not catching up:

This could be a networking/hardware issue or you may just need to get the latest snapshot from someone
