# Solana Validator Guidebook

The goal of the validator guidebook is to create documentation and resources to help potential validators and RPC operators get started.  It should also be a place for best practices and operational advice.

## Contributing

Contributions to the guidebook are welcome.  Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Building

The guidebook is a node.js application written with [docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io/).  Some knowledge of node.js development is helpful.  To build the and run application:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Once the application is running, you can view it at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
